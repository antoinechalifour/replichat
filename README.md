## Overview

Replichat leverages a modern local-first approach to deliver an ultra-fast and responsive chat experience. By keeping UI interactions local and synchronizing changes in the background, the app eliminates annoying spinners and loading states while still ensuring data consistency across multiple tabs.

## Key Features

- **Instant UI:** Fast, local-first user interface that ensures immediate responsiveness.
- **Resilient Streaming:** Robust content streaming across multiple tabs with resilient synchronization powered by Replicache.
- **Multiple Providers:** Currently supports OpenAI, with plans to integrate more providers in the future.
- **Modern Architecture:** Leverages state-of-the-art tools and frameworks to ensure reliability and scalability.

## Tech Stack

- **Tanstack Start:** Used for the web framework, authentication, and server functions.
- **Replicache:** Implements the local-first sync engine.
- **Redis Streams:** Provides resilient streaming to keep multiple tabs synchronized.
- **Postgres:** Serves as the primary database for structured data.
- **OpenAI (via ai SDK):** Used to power the chat responses.
- **Coolify:** Deployed with Coolify for a simple and robust hosting solution.
